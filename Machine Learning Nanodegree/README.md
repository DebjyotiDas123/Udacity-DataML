# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

The program will teach how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine.

## Project 2: Building a Student Intervention System

Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.

## Project 3: Explore the clusters in a dataset

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
